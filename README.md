# 🧠 LeetCode Backend Developer Study Plan

Welcome! This repository contains my **8-week backend-focused LeetCode study plan** to improve my coding skills, SQL knowledge, and system-level thinking.

📝 All algorithm solutions are written in **Java**, and SQL solutions are included where applicable.

---

## 🔍 Goal

To become a **job-ready backend developer** by solving real-world coding problems and SQL challenges, while documenting what I learn along the way.
